# EV Route Planner
-Designed a dynamic decision support system to recommend optimal charging stations along a route, based on user-defined parameters and the weighted importance of cost vs. time objectives. 
-Incorporated temperature and road profile data into the optimization  model to reflect real-world driving conditions. 
-Used Google Earth Pro to extract and analyze elevation profiles of selected routes for energy consumption modeling. 
-Developed a statistical model to estimate real-time temperature using historical and forecast data, enhancing the accuracy of energy consumption calculations.
-Conducted extensive literature research on factors affecting energy consumption and battery health, and integrated them into the mathematical formulation. 
-Gained strong experience in building linear yet dynamic optimization models, particularly for applications in smart mobility and sustainable transportation.
